# HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## Problem Statement  
Employee attrition (turnover) is a critical issue for organizations as it impacts productivity, costs, and morale. This project aims to analyze employee attrition data to identify patterns and factors contributing to employees leaving the company, helping HR make data-driven retention decisions.

## Dataset  
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset (publicly available on Kaggle)

## Tools Used  
- Power BI  
- Microsoft Excel (for preliminary data cleaning)  

## Approach  
- Explored the dataset to understand employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.  
- Cleaned data to handle missing or inconsistent values.  
- Created interactive visualizations to analyze attrition rates by department, job role, age, education, and other relevant features.

## Key Visualizations  
- Attrition rate by Department and Job Role  
- Employee Age and Tenure Distributions  
- Satisfaction Scores vs. Attrition Status  
- Monthly Income and Attrition Correlation  
- Heatmap of factors impacting attrition  

## Key Insights  
- Departments such as Sales showed higher attrition rates.  
- Employees with lower job satisfaction were more likely to leave.  
- Younger employees with shorter tenure had higher attrition.  
- Income level had a notable impact on retention.  

## Conclusion  
The dashboard provides HR professionals with actionable insights to more effectively target employee retention strategies by focusing on high-risk groups and improving job satisfaction and compensation plans.
